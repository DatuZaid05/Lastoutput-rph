        <h2>Cebu IT Park</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Georgia;">
          Cebu IT Park is a modern business and technology center in Lahug, Cebu City, Philippines. It is one of the most important IT zones in the country where many big companies and BPO offices are located. Before, this area was the old Lahug Airport, but later it was developed by Ayala Land into a place for technology, business, and innovation.<br><br>

Today, Cebu IT Park has many tall buildings, cafés, restaurants, and parks where people work and relax. It is open day and night because of call centers that work 24 hours. Many young people go there to find jobs in the IT and communication industry. It also help Cebu grow into one of the top technology cities in the Philippines.

          Cebu IT Park is a nice place in Cebu that many people know now. We choose this place because it is about computer and technology, and we are BSIT student. Before, this place was not like now. It was old Lahug Airport before, and only few people go there. But later, they build many buildings and company for IT. Now it become so busy and full of workers.
